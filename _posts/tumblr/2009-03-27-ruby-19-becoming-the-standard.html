title: Ruby 1.9 becoming the standard?
tags: 
---
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of talk recently about pushing the Ruby Community onto Ruby 1.9.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s cool, the more people using 1.9 the quicker the issues will get ironed out</p>
<p>(people need to be spurred into fixing their libraries)</p>
<p>But there is one thing standing in the way of 1.9 being adopted by the whole community, <b>Default Packages</b></p>
<p><b>Mac OSX comes with 1.8.6</b> as standard, <b>Ubuntu 8.10 comes with 1.8.7</b>.</p>
<p>Whitney Houston said &#8220;the children are our future&#8221;, and that&#8217;s exactly who we need to start using 1.9 right from the word go.</p>
<p>With <b>Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope) and OSX Snow Leopard on their way out</b> soon, surely if they adopted 1.9 as the default, we&#8217;d be on the road to success.</p>
<p>However, maybe that&#8217;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>A quick look at <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/interpreters/ruby">the packages of Jaunty Jackalope</a> and you&#8217;ll see</p>
<blockquote>This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian&#8217;s default Ruby version (currently 1.8.x).</blockquote>
<p>So I guess this thing&#8217;s not going to get fixed soon.</p>
