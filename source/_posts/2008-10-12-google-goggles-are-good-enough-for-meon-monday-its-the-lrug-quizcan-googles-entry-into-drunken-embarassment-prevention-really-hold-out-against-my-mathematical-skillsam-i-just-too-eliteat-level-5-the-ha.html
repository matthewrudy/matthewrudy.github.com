title: ! ' Google Goggles are good enough for me?

  On Monday its the LRUG quiz.

  Can Google’s entry into drunken embarassment prevention really hold out against
  my mathematical skills?

  Am I just too elite?

  At level 5 (the hardest) we still get sums like “6x9”!

  Does my mathematical ability really drop that much?

  We’ll see tomorrow!'
