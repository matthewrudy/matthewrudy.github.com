title: ! 'itâ€™s hard enough to push out a great idea,

  even if you thought of it,

  and have spent years thinking about it.


  If a potential investor is going to take the time, money, and bother to steal your
  idea,

  then someone else is going to buy it from you

  before they have a chance.'
