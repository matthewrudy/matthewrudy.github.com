<p>A <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2008/10/google-app-engine-roadmap-now-published.html">recent post</a> on the Google App Engine blog refers to;</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Support for a new runtime language&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s got to be ruby&#8230;</p>
<p>Imagine a bespoke <a href="http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/2007/10/sinatra-ruby-web-framework-and-why-it.html">Sinatra</a>-style minimal framework, with <a href="http://datamapper.org/doku.php">DataMapper</a> bindings to the <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/io/under-the-covers-of-the-google-app-engine-datastore">Google DataStore</a>.</p>
<p>No doubt it&#8217;ll be pretty quick to make it work with Merb as well.</p>
<p>AWESOME.</p>
<p>Why did google never reply to my job application asking to work on it?</p>
