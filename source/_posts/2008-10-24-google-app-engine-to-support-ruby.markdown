A [recent post][] on the Google App Engine blog refers to;

> “Support for a new runtime language”

That’s got to be ruby…

Imagine a bespoke [Sinatra][]-style minimal framework, with
[DataMapper][] bindings to the [Google DataStore][].

No doubt it’ll be pretty quick to make it work with Merb as well.

AWESOME.

Why did google never reply to my job application asking to work on it?

*(if you haven’t seen the videos from last years Google IO, then they’re
well worth watching - [here][])*
