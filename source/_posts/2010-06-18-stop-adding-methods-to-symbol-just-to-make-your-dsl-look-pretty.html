<p>I remember the first time I saw <a href="http://datamapper.org/">Datamapper</a>.</p>
<p>I liked saying &#8220;:something.gt something_else&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was pretty.</p>
<p>But after a while I realised it wasn&#8217;t necessary.</p>
<p>So why are we still building APIs that involve extending Symbol?</p>
